        <h2>These are some games designed...wait no, made by me, with a little help (only a bit)</h2>
        <p>Games use p5.js, p5.play and matter.js libraries in javascript ,theres a good chance you wont have any idea what that means but im leaving it cause it makes me sound smort</p>
        <p>to play these games click the image above the text and it well take ypou to a different site where youll play the game</p>

        <div class="grid">

        <p>this game is a remake of the google dino game.
        <br> just click on the image to get taken
        <br> to a seperate site, on this site youll play the game.
        <br>the reason it says p5 is because someone "published" 
        <br>it added the p5 logo and their name on the site.</p>

        <p>this is a self made ghost game.
            <br> basically use the space bar to jump 
            <br>and don't ram the windows.
            <br>don't ask 
        </p>

        <p>you know i love angry birds, so i remade angry birds!
            <br> with pirates and cannons and a horrific "splash" sound 
            <br>(don't shoot the water)
           <br> i couldnt be bothered to fix it shut up. 
           <br>
            <br>i can already see the stories: angry pirates
        </p>

        <p>ever played cut the rope? well i spoofed that to. 
            <br>but its a bunny that wants a melon. 
            <br>i dont know so dont ask
            <br>also it has only one level, and pretty much the 
            <br>most annoying song youll hear in any of these games 
            <br>(except for the "splash" sound)
           <br> really this is more like showing you how the physics work,
           <in my games>
            <br> and as i can't just put a "game" where you make objects fly 
            <br>around youll get this
            <br>so enjoy.

        <p>right click and open this link in a new tab.
            <br> because this ones multiplayer, 
            <br>for yourself. 
            <br>don't ask why i made a multiplayer game,
            <br> cause we both know that none of us have 
            <br>any friends to  play with...
            <br>and im not playing with you.
